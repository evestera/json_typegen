# json_typegen_shared

[json_typegen](https://typegen.vestera.as/) as just a library,
for use in build scripts and other crates.
If you want an actual interface, like a website, CLI or procedural macro, check the repo:
[github.com/evestera/json_typegen](https://github.com/evestera/json_typegen)

Note: This crate is to a certain extent considered internal API of the `json_typegen` tools.
If you want to use this crate directly, be prepared for breaking changes to happen, and consider
[opening an issue](https://github.com/evestera/json_typegen/issues/new)
to let me know what you are using. (Breaking changes may still happen,
but then I'll at least try to keep your use-case in mind if possible.
This has happened enough by now that there are parts I already consider public API.)
